# Latin to/from Likanu Transliteration Web Tool

A tool to allow Kokanu speakers to write in Likanu or turn Likanu
text into Latin script.

Copied and reformatted from [this codepen](https://codepen.io/rayzchen/pen/NPKBQMy), which
was created from a web archive of [the old translation tool](https://web.archive.org/web/20240727020438/https://www.kokanu.com/en/docs/likanu).
